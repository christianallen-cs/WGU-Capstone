## GRADUATION CAPSTONE

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This project is my capstone for the Computer Science Bachelor's program at Western Governors University. It delves into the power of machine learning to generate personalized movie recommendations. By analyzing a user's movie rating history, the model suggests five movies they are likely to enjoy. Developed in Python, the model is trained on a rich dataset comprising over 50,000 movies and 100,000 user ratings, ensuring diverse and accurate recommendations.
